    long_description = """
hgapi is a pure-Python API to Mercurial, that uses the command-line
interface instead of the internal Mercurial API. The rationale for
this is twofold: the internal API is unstable, and it is GPL.

hgapi works for Mercurial < 1.9, and will instantly reflect any
changes to the repositiry, unlike interfaces based on the
CommandServer (http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CommandServer). It
also has a really permissive license (do whatever you want, don't
blame me).

For example of code that uses this API, take a look at
https://bitbucket.org/haard/autohook which now uses hgapi
exclusively."""
