gitapi
======
gitapi is a pure-Python API to git, which uses the command-line
interface. It has a really permissive license (do whatever you want, don't
blame me).

So far, the API supports::

 git init
 git branch
 git id (git log --pretty=format:%H)
 git add
 git commit
 git status
 git log
 git checkout
 git reset
 git merge (fails on conflict)
 git push
 git pull
 git fetch
 git clone
 git tags
 git tag

You also have access to the configuration (config, configbool,
configlist).

Example usage::
    >>> import gitapi
    >>> repo = gitapi.Repo("test_gitapi") #existing folder
    >>> repo.git_init()
    >>> repo.git_add("file.txt") #already created but not added file
    >>> repo.git_commit("Adding file.txt", user="me <me@example.com>")
    >>> str(repo['HEAD'].desc)
    'Adding file.txt'

Installation
============

Super easy::

 pip install gitapi

Easy: download the source, make sure you have setuptools
installed, and then run::

 python setup.py install
